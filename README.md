# Team-Profile-Generator

## Bootcamp homework

A manager wants to generate a webpage displaying basic and accessible info for each of their team members, including email addresses and GitHub profiles. The following "Acceptance Criteria" for this feature were requested and have now been implemented:

- A command-line application was created which accepts user input
- Responses generated by the command-line application generate an HTML file including the following:
  - A header for team profiles
  - Cards for each team member, including the following details:
    - Manager: Name, ID, email address, and office number
    - Engineer(s): Name(s), ID(s), email address(es), and GitHub profile link(s)
    - Intern(s): Name(s), ID(s), email address(es), and affiliated school(s)
- All email addresses and GitHub profiles are clickable links leading to mailto: prompts or the GitHub profile pages

- Tests for the following four Node.js Classes (under "lib") have been created: Employee, Engineer, Intern, and Manager. These tests are available in the "tests" folder and have all passed (as illustrated by one of the walkthrough videos -- below).

Additionally, video walk-throughs highlighting the program's HTML functionality as well as all of the Class tests passing have been created and linked (below), and the Javascript includes comments.

## Links to video walk-throughs (two):

As the team profile generator cannot be deployed at a live URL, a video highlighting a walk-through of using this generator is included here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1itQ_y_U7pL5NeQnK8zFvyMJEjzMZw4j6/view?usp=sharing

A video highlighting all four Class tests passing is included here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Swnv_s1SSxq6NsxhXUOMsf9xct3dSGu0/view?usp=sharing
